- 👋 Hi, I’m @Liziloo. I'm from Massachusetts, but moved to Ohio in 2008. I'm also fluent in French and lived in Paris for a year, which was as wonderful as you might guess. I've been a high school teacher, web editor, book editor, freelance writer, SEO marketing specialist, youth minister and even an historic home tour guide, among other things. I have a husband and two little kids who give me joy daily, as well as drive me nuts.
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of things, including web development. I love reading, baking and doing jigsaw puzzles. I also love racing small one-design sailboats, but that's a little out of reach here in Ohio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can about web programming. In January of this year (2024), I got fed up with Google Home and moved over to Home Assistant, buying an RPi and setting it up myself, which required a little bit of programming. A month or so later, my husband bought me a mini-pc and HDD to piece together into a DIY homeserver. I ran out of things to tinker with there, and started taking Harvard's series of CS50 courses in April. It's almost November, and I've finished CS50x, CS50P and am almost to the final project of CS50W. Yesterday I decided to start working through the Odin Project, too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source software for homeservers, a grocery shopping app I'm developing that's currently implemented entirely in Python.
